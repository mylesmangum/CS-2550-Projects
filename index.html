        <h2>Overconsumption</h2>
        A poem about how much caffeine I had this morning:
        <p><em>
        I do not know why<br>
        But I'll make coffee too much<br>
        And then I jitter <br>
        </em></p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>Something that I enjoy doing is to go skiing.  I grew up on the East Coast, where there isn't as many large mountains or places to do things like ski or snowboard, 
            but I moved to Utah when I was 17 and was able to discover that year how much I enjoy it.  I actually worked at the ski resort Deer Valley for a couple of years before I started 
            school up to be able to get a season pass for free.  However, working as a lift operator doesn't pay as well as something where you need a college degree so here 
            I am now! <br></p>
        <p>I also really enjoy puzzles like Rubik's Cubes and Rotating Clocks.  I was more into it when I was a kid and had a lot more free time, but I got pretty good at them and have kept
            the skill.  My record is about 7 seconds when I was 14 years old and I have never been lucky enough to beat that record.  Now, I average about 25 seconds per solve on a cube and I 
            have a collection of over 15 different puzzles of various shapes and sizes.<br></p>
            <p>Something that relates more to computers is I really enjoy building them.  I have been able to build 7 or 8 at this point for myself, friends, and family.  However,
            this is quite the expensive hobby so I just enjoy doing it when I can and hope that someday that can be beneficial to my career or I can afford to build a beast of a setup.<br></p>
